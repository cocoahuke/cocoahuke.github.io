If you have ever wanted to take photos with your iPhone’s camera without actually launching the Camera application then you are in luck as a new Cydia tweak called Taker is here to help. Taker tweak integrates with Ryan Petrich’s popular Activator, allowing users to select volume buttons in order to secretly take still photos. The best thing about this tweak is that you don’t have to open the Camera application, as it takes the shot right when you perform the assigned volume button action.

The photos taken with the help of this tweak are as normal as the ones taken from within the app, which means they are stored in the Photos app ready to be edited, shared or being deleted. Since you can already take photos with the upper volume button when using the Camera application, this tweak is simply an extension of that feature.
