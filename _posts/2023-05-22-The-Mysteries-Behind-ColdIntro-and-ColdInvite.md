desc:   Check out how a new iPhone threat was discovered, where attackers can bypass security by exploiting weak co-processors, giving them a way to dig deeper into the iOS kernel.

A vulnerability that was believed to be patched back in 2022 by Apple is more mysterious than researchers initially believed it to be. The patch mitigated a vulnerability that was exploited in the wild as part of an attack chain targeting co-processors.

During the process of analyzing ColdIntro (CVE-2022-32894), I discovered another vulnerability that allows attackers to escape a co-processor and initiate memory corruption in the Application Processor (AP) â€” named ColdInvite (CVE-2023-27930).

ColdInvite impacts iPhone users by taking advantage of a vulnerability in certain versions of iOS.
